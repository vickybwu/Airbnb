## Research Motivation
If you have a spare place in NYC, you probably have thought about getting into the Airbnb business. You can rent out a room for $2000 per month but if you were to rent it on Airbnb, you can charge $150 per night. Sounds mad lucrative, I know. 

However, not every host on Airbnb is that lucky, you can’t charge as much as you want because there are too many competitors out there and there will always be cold nights your listing doesn’t get any tenants. To make your listing profitable, there are lots of factors to take into consideration. 

That’s why we are here to help. We want to study how you can improve your business and make a killing on Airbnb. We want to give you advice on how to boost your listing value, improve your ratings, and become a superhost.

We extracted a random sample from June, 2018 Airbnb NYC listings and performed several statistical tests to find out the deciding factors of overall ratings, occupancy rate, price and overall revenues. Now it’s time to reveal the secrets of running a six-figure business on Airbnb...

## Research Findings
The occurrence of the first negative review affects negatively the probability to have a transaction; while the following others have positive effects.

There are five lodging aspects that customers most care about: communication, experience, location, product/service, and value. Customers have different sentiments toward different lodging aspects, which lead to different aspect evaluation weights and aspect ratings when they judge their overall stays with the accommodations offered on sharing accommodation platforms.

Airbnb has removed between 7,000 and 13,500 units of housing from New York City’s long-term rental market. In large parts of the city, hosts of frequently rented entire-home Airbnb listings earn 200% or more the median long-term neighborhood rent.

NYC listings are concentrated in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, but are growing rapidly in Brooklyn, and taking up a larger and larger portion of the overall Airbnb market over time.
